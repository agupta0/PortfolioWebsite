        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm a CS enthusiast with a passion for coding and creativity. Currently navigating the exciting world of computer science at Georgia Tech, I'm fluent in Java and venturing into the realms of Python and web development languages. Whether it's crafting elegant algorithms or building sleek user interfaces, I'm all in to learn new technical skills!
        </p>
        <p>But hey, life isn't just about the code, right? When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, you'll find me in the kitchen, whipping up delicious treats. Baking isn't just a hobby for me; it's a form of artistry that brings joy to others. You can catch a glimpse of my culinary adventures on my Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wholesome_whisk_/?hl=en">@wholesome_whisk_</a></p>
        <p>And let's not forget the importance of a good laugh! I'm a connoisseur of dad jokes and puns‚Äîafter all, humor is the ultimate debugging tool, isn't it? Here's one for the road: Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! üêû
        </p>
        <p>With a knack for problem-solving and a taste for the sweet things in life, I'm on a mission to blend innovation with a sprinkle of humor. Let's connect and create something awesome together!</p>
